Almost two years ago I left my old life behind in the UK, sold everything I
owned, and moved to Spain with the aim of changing career from procurement
professional to software developer, by way of full-time self-guided learning. In
that time I have taken many online courses, and have recently questioned myself:
"How much have I **_really learned"?_**

It's easy to get caught in a tutorial loop. It feels safe and comfortable having
our hand held, shown what to do, given small challenges to build our confidence.
But when it comes to applying what I've learned to my own projects, it often
feels like I've forgotten what to do. So how could this be improved? Can we gain
some sort of superpower to remember everything that we learn forever? Well, not
quite, but the next best thing is to become an efficient learner.

The Udemy course
[Learning to Learn](https://www.udemy.com/course/learning-to-learn-efficient-learning-zero-to-mastery)
by Andrei Neagoie, has enlightened me with the realisation that I have been
learning inefficiently for the past year and a half. Don't get me wrong, I have
come a long way, but I could have done better. So armed with a set of new
learning techniques perhaps those superpowers have become a step closer.

Paradoxically, this blog post actually serves to implement a learning technique
in itself, the Feyman Technique, which I am using to summarise what I have
learned in Andrei's course in order to solidify my understanding of the topic,
but more on that later!

The course starts by introducing the five main sections:

1.  **Principles**
2.  **Lies**
3.  **Pillars**
4.  **Science**
5.  **Techniques**

These sections as a whole can be visualized like a pyramid, with principles
forming the base and techniques being at the top. So let's dive in to each topic
one by one with a summary of the main points.

### 1. Principles

#### Useful principles & guidelines to being a self-motivated learner.

**Learning vs Winning the system**: Being smart doesn't automatically lead to
success. By becoming an efficient learner we aim to win the system. Getting the
most out of the learning content consumed will help on the path to success.

**Shift focus from getting the best result to a long-term learning mindset**. It
is more important to take value from learning progress in the long term than it
is to value short term wins such as good grades or a promotion.

**Being an efficient learner is great, but to succeed you need drive and
persistence**. Drive can come from within or from external factors like monetary
incentives, but you need to find what motivates you and then persistently apply
it if you seek to master your craft.

**Embrace obstacles**: In order to progress, you need to always push yourself to
the edge of your abilities. If something is hard, then you are doing it right.
Nobody is successful in the outset, we grow by challenging what we are capable
of and expanding our limitations.

**The dip**: There will be times when you feel like you will never 'get' a
topic. Push through those moments, and remember that progress is being made.
Maintain that drive and persistence, and you will get to where you want to be.

**Compound learning**: Learn in smaller chunks rather than all day learning
sessions. This will help with some of the techniques explained later.

**Failures don't count against us**: People don't remember us for the past
failures we have made. They remember us for where we are now, not who we were
when we failed. The most successful people in life always get to where they are
by failing many times on their journey.

**Failures are good**: The more failures we have, the more critical feedback we
receive. Failure is essential to improvement.

**Choice vs Chore:** Shift focus from "I must do" to "I want to" in order to
grow. If it feels like a chore then it is harder to undertake. It really helps
if you enjoy the subject you want to learn.

**Use frames to change view or perspective.** Instead of thinking "I can't do
this", think "I am improving at this". Turn a perspective of loss into a gain.
See the framing effect on
[Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)>) for
more info.

**The Pareto principle**: 80% of the results come from 20% of the effort.
Eliminate from 100% until you reach the 20% which will give 80% of results.
Focus on the critical skills that will give you the most results.

**Skill stacking**: There are 3 important approaches to career strategy:

1.  **Curiosity**: The innate ambition to learn continuously.
2.  **Value learning above all else**: Choose a job where everyone is smarter
    than you, over a high salary and lots of perks.
3.  **Gather and combine skills in a unique way**: Stand out from the crowd by
    leveraging your unique skills.

The most valuable skills to stack are ones that are compatible, but are
different enough to make you stand out.

**Monitor the things in life that make you happy**: You will learn more
effectively when happy. Make a list of 5-7 happiness factors; things that make
you happy, and keep them in check every few months.

**Your productivity time**: Identify the time of the day when you are most
productive and focus your learning at that time.

**The self-learning paradigm:** Use everything on this list and find your
motivation from within. If you can find intrinsic motivation to drive you, then
you will be well setup for efficient learning.

### 2. Lies

#### Popular myths debunked.

##### **1. Follow your passion.**

Learning a valuable skill, getting smarter & gaining recognition makes a career
enjoyable.

You don't have to be passionate about the subject, you just need to have an
interest in it. Having an interest will make the topics interesting to learn,
and help you to maintain your ambition to improve.

Creativity, control and impact in your chosen field, combined with a valuable
skill set makes the passion arise.

Have a craftsman mindset: How can you improve and offer something uniquely
valuable. Work hard, get good, and master the craft.

##### **2. You can avoid risk.**

To achieve success, learn to tolerate and accept risks. Put yourself in
uncomfortable positions to grow.

When you notice butterflies in your stomach, you are doing something worthwhile.
Embrace the butterflies.

View risks as challenges to look forward to. Reframe risk, change your
perspective.

You need to accept risk in order to make exceptional discoveries or leaps
forward in your field. Nobody has made a significant impact in a field by being
risk-averse.

##### **3. Trust one person.**

Don't believe everything one particular leader alone says. It's true, there are
great people with admirable achievements, but theirs are only one person's
perspective.

Look at unique sources and learn to combine opinions. Don't obtain all your
information from a single source and take it as the truth.

Use other perspectives to form your own opinions and thoughts, and be able to
stand by them and give justification to your arguments.

##### **4. The 10,000 hour rule.**

Practice is important, but the 10,000 hour rule has been debunked. There are
more factors to consider than practice alone.

There is an element of luck that comes into play. Everyone has advantages and
disadvantages. Someone with a wealthy family may have more opportunities in life
than someone who doesn't. Some people are more naturally gifted at certain
things than others.

To level the playing field, use efficient learning techniques. Efficient
learning beats hard learning every time.

### 3. Pillars

#### Four pillars of foundations for implementing learning techniques.

##### **1. Everything is a game.**

This mode of thinking allows two things to happen:

1.  Growth mindset: Talent and intelligence aren't just gifts, they can be
    learned with effort and strategy.
2.  Locus of control: To improve skills we need to accept responsibility that we
    control outcomes, rather than blaming external factors when things go
    unfavourably.

##### **2. The Feynman Technique.**

I mentioned this in my introduction - In order to really understand a topic, you
need to be able to teach it.

The [Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/) has 4 steps:

1.  Choose a concept you want to learn about
2.  Pretend you are teaching it to a 12 year old student
3.  Identify gaps in your explanation; Go back to the source material, to better
    understand it
4.  Review and simplify (optional)

Bringing down a concept to its basic level and being able to explain a topic in
simple terms is the best way to learn.

##### **3. Trunk based knowledge.**

In order to master a subject, we need to be start at the trunk before you reach
the leaves.

Start with the principles, the foundations, and only move to more detailed
topics after you have a solid understanding of the fundamentals.

##### **4. Efficiency trumps grit.**

Being busy is seen as a good thing in society, but in reality it means you lack
time management skills.

By using the right strategies, methods and learning the right topics, you are
learning efficiently.

### 4. Science

#### The science on which efficient learning foundations are based.

**Focus vs Diffuse**: We have two modes of learning. Focus mode is a period of
intense, focused learning. Diffuse is when our mind is in a rested state, when
you allow your mind to wander. Switching between the two modes is key to
efficient learning.

**Multitasking** is usually a bad strategy, and causes dual task interference,
where cognitive efficiency depletes.

**Brain training** strengthens the connections (synapses) between brain cells
(neurons).

**Sleep is extremely important** for long term learning. When we sleep our brain
flushes out toxins built up during the day, and forms new synapses while we
sleep.

**Physical exercise** is fantastic for efficient learning. It encourages the
diffuse mode of thinking for strengthening those neural connections.

**Feedback is integral to learning**, both positive and negative. Positive
feedback works best when you begin to learn a subject, encouraging you to
persist. However critical feedback is more effective and immediate feedback is
ideal.

**Procrastination** is something everyone deals with. They key is to manage your
emotion over your time. To overcome procrastination, focus on undertaking the
very first step, just make a start on the task, and you will find that you
become immediately engaged.

**Long term memory** is where fundamental principles are stored, and is formed
by practising and repeating.

**Short term or 'working' memory** is temporary, and in most people allows for
four chunks of information to be stored. Spaced repetition is used to transfer
into long term memory, when the synapses are strengthened.

**Active vs passive learning**: Active engagement is more effective than passive
learning. Passively watching a lecture creates and illusion of competence.

**Practice what you have learned through doing**. Memory retrieval is more
effective than re-reading material.

**Intrinsic motivation** comes from within, what we want to do. **Extrinsic
motivation**comes from external factors, such as a pay rise or promotion.

Three factors facilitate intrinsic drive:

1.  Autonomy: Control over what you are learning.
2.  Mastery: Desire to be a master of your chosen subject.
3.  Purpose: The "bigger picture". Working towards something greater and more
    important.

**Small steps** in completing goals eliminates the fear of failure. Breaking
down a daunting task into manageable chunks makes it more approachable.

**SMART criteria** is a guide for setting objectives:
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria).

- Specific – target a specific area for improvement.
- Measurable – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.
- Assignable – specify who will do it.
- Realistic – state what results can realistically be achieved, given available
  resources.
- Time-related – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.

**It pays not to be busy**. Healthy, leisurely time is crucial. Taking breaks
results in more efficient learning.

**Chunking** (bottom up learning) is the combination of chunks of knowledge.
Forming the connections between chunks (top down learning) combined with the
chunks themselves creates knowledge of a subject.

**Problems are solved** by engaging two modes of thinking: Focus mode and
diffuse mode (intuition).

**Deliberate practice**: Pushing past the perceived limit once a plateau is
reached. Concentrate on things just outside of your cognitive ability. There are
four things required for deliberate practice:

1.  Specific goals.
2.  Intense focus.
3.  Immediate feedback.
4.  Frequent discomfort.

**Spaced repetition** is the best way to create long term memory by strengthening
synaptic neurons.

**Save energy with habits**. Not having to focus on something saves energy.
Forming habits is a great way to drive efficient learning.

**We remember things better when in an adventurous state**. When doing something
new or when experimenting we improve our memory.

**Have an endpoint**: Establish a time to finish a focused learning session.

**Be bored**: Allow the mind to enter a diffuse state. Do nothing at all for
optimum diffuse mode thinking.

### 5. Techniques

#### Proven techniques for efficient learning.

##### **1. The Pomodoro Technique**

- 25 minutes of focused learning followed by 5 minutes of rest in the diffuse
  state.
- Always start with the task you least want to undertake, or the hardest.
- Helps with procrastination.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) there
are six steps:

1.  Decide on the task to be done.
2.  Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
3.  Work on the task.
4.  End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
5.  If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes),
    then go to step 2.
6.  After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your
    checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.

##### **2. Chunk the subject**

- Combine smaller pieces of information to gain knowledge of a subject.
- Implement the
  [divde and conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm)
  algorithm principles.
- Break down larger, complex things into manageable chunks.
- Write one page to summarise everything about a subject. If it doesn't fit on
  one side of paper, you haven't chunked enough.

##### **3. Spaced repetition**

- An evidence-based
  [learning technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) that is
  usually performed with flashcards.
- The only way to create long term memories.
- Use varied techniques for spaced repetition through research.
- Repetitive over-learning can cause the
  [forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve).
- Recalling and retrieving information causes reconciliation which strengthens
  the neural synapses.
- This is why the
  [Feynman technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/) works so well.
- Diagrams are a good way to enhance spaced repetition.

##### **4. Deliberate practice**

- Avoid the easy tasks and take on challenging projects.
- Put yourself in situations that are consistently challenging.
- Use focus time daily.
- Push yourself to the limits of your capabilities; be uncomfortable.
- Always seek immediate feedback, preferably critical.
- Record your progress and measure it.

##### **5. Create a roadmap**

- Mastery of a subject requires connections between chunks to be understood.
- Prepare, plan, create a curriculum and execute it.
- Select high quality resources to learn from.
- Focus on industry leaders and learn from a variety of their opinions.
- What are the most important topics? implement the Pareto principle.
- What type of results will result in recognition and respect from peers?

##### **6. Interleaving**

- A technique to use different problems and sessions to learn something.
- Use a variety of learning resources and problems to gain better knowledge.
- Form knowledge from multiple perspectives.

##### **7. Einstellung**

- Avoid the
  [Einstellung effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstellung_effect): A
  rigid mindset that prevents you from expanding your horizons.
- Once you are no longer a beginner, your acceptance of criticism can decrease.
- Constantly explore new ideas and be accepting of different opinions.
- Sometimes your knowledge may not be accurate. Be open to new concepts.
- Always ask "what is option C?" - There might be a more innovative approach.

##### **8. Importance of community**

- If you are not part of a community you will be at a disadvantage.
- Community can provide feedback and uncover blind spots in your knowledge.
- Find motivation from others learning the same subject.
- Seek accountability from others in completion of your objectives.
- Be surrounded by people who excel you and propel you to improve.

##### **9. Habits**

- Habits are automatic and don't require concentration, therefore saving energy.
- Practice the [habit loop](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/The_Habit_Loop):

1.  Cue - the trigger
2.  Routine - the ritual
3.  Reward - the reinforcement

- Practice the four laws of behaviour change:

1.  Obvious: Is the habit obvious, with a roadmap and clear goal?
2.  Easy: Is it easy as possible to form this habit?
3.  Attractive: Is the outcome attractive to us?
4.  Satisfying: Does this habit reward us?

- Build consistency:
  [Don't break the chain](https://www.writersstore.com/dont-break-the-chain-jerry-seinfeld/)

##### **10. System vs Goals**

- Favour a system; a repeatable set of actions, over the overarching goal.
- A Goal is a rigid objective, whereas a system is a way to do something
  regularly with the expectation of improvement.
- Success in life usually comes from skills obtained, but luck is also a factor.
  Life events can happen and change our direction.
- Systems allow us to be flexible and adapt to events that may send us off
  course.
- Systems can eventually become habits over time.

##### **11. The power of the senses**

- Imagery, metaphors, analogies and stories all help greatly with recall.
- Visual memory and sensual memory help us to form strong neural synapses.
- Adding an emotional element to learning helps solidify memory.
- Seek new experiences outside of learning to stimulate the brain.
- Learn in locations that stimulate your senses.
- Make your study area a stimulating environment, with colourful decorations,
  and pleasant fragrances.

##### **12. The method of Loci**

- Also known as the method of place, the
  [method of Loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci) is a memory
  enhancement technique.
- It works by associating spacial visualisations and stories that allow for
  efficient recall.
- Exploits the natural spacial memory advantage humans posses.

##### **13. The Pareto principle**

- The principle that 80% of the results are achieved from 20% of effort.
- Use the 80/20 rule to prioritise the most important topics to learn.
- Ask yourself: "Is this the best use of my time?" and "is this information
  critical?"
- Remove the unnecessary.
- Focus on 20% of the highest quality, most crucial information.
- It is equally as important to select as it is to remove.

##### **14. Parkinson's law**

- [Parkinson’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law) is the
  adage that “work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion”.
- By using small systems and goals with specific deadlines, it forces us to work
  within a constrained time frame.

##### **15. Deep work**

- Intensely focused, highly engaged work or practice.
- Ensure no distractions to push your cognitive abilities to the limit.
- Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively
  challenging task.
- Conversely, shallow work is non-cognitively demanding , logistical-style work,
  often performed while distracted.

##### **16. Stakes and rewards**

- Focus on small rewards to stay motivated.
- What happens when you don't achieve your goal? Stakes need to be on the line.
- Hold yourself accountable for failures to reach goals.
- Stakes are the things we lose when we don't achieve goals.

##### **17. Concepts vs Facts**

- Concepts are more important than facts.
- Facts are easy to Google, concepts need to be learned.
- Recalling something is more effective than repeating something.
- Concepts are high level topics that give context of the subject learned.
- Successful people understand concepts to to connect the chunks of knowledge
  and arrive at novel solutions.
- Foundations and principles are important (trunk based knowledge) to form
  connections between the chunks.
- Always ask "why" to form the connections.
- The Feynman technique is important to explain topics, and leads to true
  knowledge of any topic.

##### **18. Test yourself**

- Without practice no significant progress can be made.
- Summarise after learning any topic, recalling what you have learned.
- What are they key takeaways? Quiz yourself.
- Testing yourself creates immediate feedback.

And that concludes the course summary. The important thing to take away for me
is that the course content is backed by science, and some incredibly intelligent
people have dedicated countless hours to these findings over a long period of
time. Therefore I will be applying these techniques to my future learning
endeavours, and delving deeper into each of the areas covered.

This blog post deliberately doesn't go into detail on what has been covered in
the course. I recommend
[purchasing the course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learning-to-learn-efficient-learning-zero-to-mastery)
yourself, if like myself you wish to master your craft through efficient
learning.

I will also be working my way through the books recommended in the course, to
further hone my learning techniques over time.
