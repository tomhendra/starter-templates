The common use of client-side routers to handle redirects is not a good idea, because browsers and search engines don't receive the status code of 301 / 302 for a redirect that would usually be sent by a server. This can have a negative effect on SEO and alter browser behaviour, so it is a much better idea to ensure our redirects happen on the server or CDN and not the client.

In a React (CRA) AWS Amplify app we need to apply our configurations in the three places that a server is used:

1. The Webpack development server
2. The local server used to test production builds
3. AWS Amplify

## The Development Server

CRA allows us to modify the Express server that is used foe the dev server by defining our own configuration in a `.src/setupProxy.js` file.

We can pass an Express app to the exported function and define a redirect that says anytime the browser requests the home route `/` the dev server will redirect it to the dashboard route.

```jsx
function proxy(app) {
  app.get(/^\/$/, (req, res) => res.redirect('/dashboard'));
}

module.exports = proxy;
```

## The Local Server

When we want to test our production build locally before submitting to QA, we use a local server. A common recommendation is the `serve` module from Vercel. To configure redirects we create a `serve.json` file in the `public` directory.

```json
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/",
      "destination": "/dashboard",
      "type": 302
    }
  ]
}
```

### AWS Amplify

Head to the Amplify Console and set the redirects using the UI.

### Summary

Although it is not very typical to redirect all users from the root route to another route, it is typical to redirect an old route to a new one, or a short version of the URL to the full version, and this should definitely happen on the server side so that the status codes can be set properly.

## Extra: Fix the Access Denied Error with AWS Amplify

When a React application is deployed to AWS Amplify with client-side routing configured, assets are sometimes not loaded properly when the browser is refreshed which can result in an error like this one.

This is apparently not a problem with Amplify but that is where we apply the solution. In the Amplify console go to rewrites & redirects and add a new rule.

Source address: `</^((?!\.(css|gif|ico|jpg|js|png|txt|svg|woff|ttf)$).)*$/>`

Target address: `/index.html`

Type: `200 (Rewrite`

Deploy a test build to AWS Amplify and the issue should be solved.
